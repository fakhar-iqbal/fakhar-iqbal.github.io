## [Practice Project 1: Dog vs Cat Classifier](https://github.com/fakhar-iqbal/FastaiImplementations/tree/main/ComputerVision)
I made a computer vision model hosted in gradio, on huggingfaces, in Fastai, which classifies between dogs and cats. Have a look in my repo! Click the title!

## [Practice Project 2: Player Classifier](https://github.com/fakhar-iqbal/FastaiImplementations/tree/main/ComputerVision)
I made a computer vision model, hosted in gradio on huggingfaces, which differs between two categories of people. Ronaldo and Messi. Funny!

## [Practice Project 3: Bear Detector](https://github.com/fakhar-iqbal/FastaiImplementations/tree/main/ComputerVision)
In this model, I classified between 3 types of bears, black, teddy and grizzly. With 100% accuracy. This app prototype is also hosted on huggingfaces spaces.
