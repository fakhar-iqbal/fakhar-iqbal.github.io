# Deploying ML models?

Just type !𝐩𝐢𝐩 𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐝𝐢𝐨, and you are almost done with deployment. 

It is very common that ML practitioners and Data scientists don't know much about Web-development. It's a nightmare for many, atleast for me, Yes!



Then comes `gradio` , hosted on `huggingface spaces`, the best platform to showcase your ML models. This is the best way for real-time AI trials. 



After exporting just a basic Cat vs Dog model, i wrote a very frew lines of code, that hosted the web-interface for my model.

One can easily interact with uploading and clearing the inputs, and looking for the desired outputs.
