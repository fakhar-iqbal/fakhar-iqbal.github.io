# Projects

## [Project 1: Dog vs Cat Classifier](https://github.com/fakhar-iqbal/FastaiImplementations/tree/main)
I made a computer vision model hosted in gradio, on huggingfaces, in Fastai, which classifies between dogs and cats. Have a look in my repo!

## [Project 2: Person Classifier](https://github.com/fakhar-iqbal/FastaiImplementations/tree/main)
I made a computer vision model, hosted in gradio on huggingfaces, which differs between two categories of people. Me and Messi. Funny!
