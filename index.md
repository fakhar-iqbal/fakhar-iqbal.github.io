Hi, 
I am Muhammad Fakhar, a Computer Science student, mainly focused in Data Science and Machine Learning. 
As a Machine Learning practitioner, I have been writing posts and blogs on Data science and ML, here too. 
Thank you for visiting my blog page. I hope you enjoy my articles!
Thank you.

## Sinlge Label Classification

### [Practice 1: Dog vs Cat Classifier](https://github.com/fakhar-iqbal/FastaiImplementations/tree/main/ComputerVision/Dog_vs_CatApp.ipynb)
I made a computer vision model hosted in gradio, on huggingfaces, in Fastai, which classifies between dogs and cats. Have a look in my repo! Click the title!

### [Practice 2: Player Classifier](https://github.com/fakhar-iqbal/FastaiImplementations/tree/main/ComputerVision/PlayerClassifier.ipynb)
I made a computer vision model, hosted in gradio on huggingfaces, which differs between two categories of people. Ronaldo and Messi. Funny!

### [Practice 3: Bear Detector](https://github.com/fakhar-iqbal/FastaiImplementations/tree/main/ComputerVision/BearClassifierPrototype.ipynb)
In this model, I classified between 3 types of bears, black, teddy and grizzly. With 100% accuracy. This app prototype is also hosted on huggingfaces spaces.

### [Practice 4: MNIST Digits Classification](https://github.com/fakhar-iqbal/FastaiImplementations/blob/main/ComputerVision/DigitClassifierNNfromScratch.ipynb)
In this model, I just took2 digits, as provided as Samples in the dataset. I implemented the Neural Network from scratch to classify the single label. This uses softmax activation function and CrossEntropyLoss. 

### [Practice 5: Pet Breed Classification](https://github.com/fakhar-iqbal/FastaiImplementations/blob/main/ComputerVision/PetBreedsNN.ipynb)
In this model, I implemented classifying between 37 different cats and dog breeds. This uses softmax activation function, and CrossEntropyLoss.
