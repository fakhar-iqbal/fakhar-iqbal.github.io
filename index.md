# Hi, I'm Muhammad Fakhar

As a Machine Learning practitioner, I have been writing posts and blogs on Data science and ML, here too. Thank you for visiting my blog page. I hope you enjoy my articles!

### [Machine Price Prediction](https://github.com/fakhar-iqbal/MachineryPriceEstimator_End_to_End_Project "Machine Price Prediction")
  
In this app, I implemented Random Forest model to generate the price of Machinery based on previous auction data.

### Computer Vision

#### Images Regression

[Practice 1: Centre of Head](https://github.com/fakhar-iqbal/FastaiImplementations/blob/main/ComputerVision/ImagesRegression.ipynb "Centre of Head")

In this model, I implemented images regression, to find the coordinates of the centre of the head. It uses MSELoss.

#### Sinlge Label Classification

[Practice 1: Dog vs Cat Classifier](https://github.com/fakhar-iqbal/FastaiImplementations/tree/main/ComputerVision/Dog_vs_CatApp.ipynb "Dog vs Cat Classifier") 

I made a computer vision model hosted in gradio, on huggingfaces, in Fastai, which classifies between dogs and cats. Have a look in my repo! Click the title!


[Practice 2: Player Classifier](https://github.com/fakhar-iqbal/FastaiImplementations/tree/main/ComputerVision/PlayerClassifier.ipynb "Player Classifier")

I made a computer vision model, hosted in gradio on huggingfaces, which differs between two categories of people. Ronaldo and Messi. Funny!

[Practice 3: Bear Detector](https://github.com/fakhar-iqbal/FastaiImplementations/tree/main/ComputerVision/BearClassifierPrototype.ipynb "Bear Detector") 

In this model, I classified between 3 types of bears, black, teddy and grizzly. With 100% accuracy. This app prototype is also hosted on huggingfaces spaces.



[Practice 4: MNIST Digits Classification](https://github.com/fakhar-iqbal/FastaiImplementations/blob/main/ComputerVision/DigitClassifierNNfromScratch.ipynb "MNIST Classifier")

In this model, I just took2 digits, as provided as Samples in the dataset. I implemented the Neural Network from scratch to classify the single label. This uses softmax activation function and CrossEntropyLoss.


[Practice 5: Pet Breed Classification](https://github.com/fakhar-iqbal/FastaiImplementations/blob/main/ComputerVision/PetBreedsNN.ipynb "Pet Breed Classifier")

In this model, I implemented classifying between 37 different cats and dog breeds. This uses softmax activation function, and CrossEntropyLoss.

#### Multi-Label Classification

[Practice 1: Predicting Multipple classes](https://github.com/fakhar-iqbal/FastaiImplementations/blob/main/ComputerVision/MultiLabelClassification.ipynb "Multi-Label Classifier")

In this model, I predicted multiple classes present in the picture. This uses sigmoid activation function and BCELossWithLogits loss.

### Tabular Data

<div class="project">

[Practice 1: Movies Prediction/Collaborative Filtering](https://github.com/fakhar-iqbal/FastaiImplementations/blob/main/Collab_filtering_TabularData/CollaborativeFiltering(onMovies).ipynb "Movie Recommender")

In this collaborative friltering, I worked on movies dataset, to predict the movie for a user based on his reviews.

<div class="project">

[Practice 2: Price Prediction from previous auctions](https://github.com/fakhar-iqbal/FastaiImplementations/blob/main/Collab_filtering_TabularData/TabularDataModel.ipynb "Price Predictor") 

In this model. based on previous prices of machines on auctions, I predicted the price for new machinery. I used the data from kaggle.(bluebook for bulldozers)

### Natural Language Processing

<div class="project">

[Practice 1: Generating text for movie reviews/ Classifying the reviews](https://github.com/fakhar-iqbal/FastaiImplementations/blob/main/NLP/LanguageModel_NLP_final.ipynb "Movie Review Classifier")

In this Language Model, I predicted the text to write the reviews for movies. Also, I classified them as positive review or negative review.
